//? Summary: Dynamic programming is a technique that combines the correctness of complete search and efficiency of greedy algorithms 
/* 
    feat: Use of the dynamic algorithms: 
    ?    Finding an optimal solution: Find a solution that is as large/small as possible
    ?    Counting the number of solutions: Calculate the totgal number of possible solutions
