//? Description: Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
/* 
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
