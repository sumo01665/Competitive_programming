Question problem: 

[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]


//First step: m = rows, n = columns 
Running through the first rows: matrix[0][0] -> matrix[0][n]
Running through the last rows: matrix[0][n] -> matrix[m][n] 


//?Two approaches: recursive: Base case: m x n = 1; 
			               Recursive step: [0][0] -> [0][n - 1]
						       [0][n-1] -> [m - 1][n - 1]								
		   iterative:
